Filename Templates
==================

Make filenames from string templates.
This package exposes the `FileNames` class, which keeps a list of filenames and provides a wrapper around `string.format` with some bells and whisles to make the syntax super nice.

I wrote this to keep track of filenames during data analysis projects, where there are many files, which names follow a standard pattern. For example: `data-day001.csv data-day002.csv data-day003.csv`. Processing these files may produce: `data-day001-processed.csv data-day002-processed.csv data-day003-processed.csv`. In these cases, it is good practice to define the templates for these filenames once, for example in a configuration file, and re-use them in the different analysis scripts.

Installation
------------
either through pip:

    pip install filename-templates

or from the repository:

    python setup.py install

To run the tests:

    python -m pytest --doctest-module


Usage
-----

Use the `add` method to add new filenames. You specify a short "alias" for
them, which you can use to retrieve the full filename later:

```python
>>> from filename_templates import FileNames
>>> fname = FileNames()
>>> fname.add('my_file', '/path/to/file1')
>>> fname.my_file
PosixPath('/path/to/file1')
```

Filenames can also be templates that can be used to generate
filenames for different subjects, conditions, etc.:

```python
>>> fname = FileNames()
>>> fname.add('epochs', '/data/{subject}/{cond}-epo.fif')
>>> fname.epochs(subject='sub001', cond='face')
PosixPath('/data/sub001/face-epo.fif')
```

Templates can contain placeholders in the way `string.format` allows,
including formatting options:

```python
>>> fname = FileNames()
>>> fname.add('epochs', '/data/sub{subject:03d}/{cond}-epo.fif')
>>> fname.epochs(subject=1, cond='face')
PosixPath('/data/sub001/face-epo.fif')
```

If a placeholder happens to be the alias of a file that has been added earlier,
the placeholder is automatically filled:

```python
>>> fname = FileNames()
>>> fname.add('subjects', '/data/subjects_dir')
>>> fname.add('epochs', '{subjects}/{subject}/{cond}-epo.fif')
>>> fname.epochs(subject='sub001', cond='face')
PosixPath('/data/subjects_dir/sub001/face-epo.fif')
```

If all placeholders could be automatically filled, no brackets () are required
when accessing it:

```python
>>> fname = FileNames()
>>> fname.add('subjects', '/data/subjects_dir')
>>> fname.add('fsaverage', '{subjects}/fsaverage-src.fif')
>>> fname.fsaverage
PosixPath('/data/subjects_dir/fsaverage-src.fif')
```

The returned filenames are of type
[`pathlib.Path`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html), which offers
a bunch of convenience methods related to filenames that you wouldn't get with
ordinary strings. They can be used in all locations were you would otherwise
use a string filename. However, if you want an ordinary string, there are two
ways of doing so. One is to cast the filename to a string:

```python
>>> fname = FileNames()
>>> fname.add('my_file', '/path/to/file1')
>>> str(fname.my_file)
'/path/to/file1'
```

If you want all of your filenames to be strings, always, then you can pass
`as_str=True` when creating the `FileNames` object:

```python
>>> fname = FileNames(as_str=True)
>>> fname.add('my_file', '/path/to/file1')
>>> fname.my_file
'/path/to/file1'
```

Obviously this also works when the filename contains placeholders:

```python
>>> fname = FileNames(as_str=True)
>>> fname.add('my_file', '/path/to/file{subject:d}')
>>> fname.my_file(subject=1)
'/path/to/file1'
```

If computing the file path gets more complicated than the cases above, you can
supply your own function. When the filename is requested, your function will
get called with the FileNames object as first parameter, followed by any
parameters that were supplied along with the request:

```python
>>> from pathlib import Path
>>> fname = FileNames()
>>> fname.add('basedir', '/data/subjects_dir')
>>> def my_function(files, subject):
...     if subject == 1:
...         return files.basedir / '103hdsolli.fif'
...     else:
...         return files.basedir / f'{subject}.fif'
>>> fname.add('complicated', my_function)
>>> fname.complicated(subject=1)
PosixPath('/data/subjects_dir/103hdsolli.fif')
```

Instead of adding one filename at a time, you can add a dictionary of them all
at once:

```python
>>> fname = FileNames()
>>> fname_dict = dict(
...     subjects = '/data/subjects_dir',
...     fsaverage = '{subjects}/fsaverage-src.fif',
... )
>>> fname.add_from_dict(fname_dict)
>>> fname.fsaverage
PosixPath('/data/subjects_dir/fsaverage-src.fif')
```

When declaring filenames, you can tag them with `mkdir=True`. Whenever a
filename that is tagged in this manner is accessed, the parent directory will
be created if it doesn't exist yet.

```python
>>> import os.path
>>> fname = FileNames()
>>> fname.add('my_file', 'path/to/file1', mkdir=True)
>>> os.path.exists(fname.my_file.parent)
True
```
